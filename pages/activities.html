The area overlooks the Shangu River, the Bay of Bengal and the hilly range along the Myanmar border.

                <h5>History & Heritage of Bandarban </h5>

                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Bandarban</strong> is a district in South-Eastern Bangladesh, and a part of the Chittagong Division and Chittagong Hill Tracts. It is regarded as one of the most attractive travel places in Bangladesh. Bandarban (meaning the dam of monkeys), or in Marma or in Arakanese language as “Rwa-daw Mro” is also known as Arvumi or the Bohmong Circle (the other two hill districts Rangamati is known as the Chakma Circle and Khagrachari is known as the Mong Circle). Bandarban town is the home of the Bohmong Chief (currently King, or Raja, Aung Shwe Prue Chowdhury who is the head of the Marma population). It also is the administrative headquarters of Bandarban District, which has turned into one of the most exotic tourist spot in Bangladesh since the insurgency in Chittagong Hill Tracts has ceased more than a decade back.</p>

                <br>

                <p>One of the three hill districts of Bangladesh and a part of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bandarban (4,479 km²) is not only the remotest district of the country, but also is the least populated (population 292,900). The three highest peaks of Bangladesh – Tahjindong (1280 m, also known as Bijoy), Mowdok Mual (1052 m), and Keokradong (1230 m) – are located in Bandarban District, as well as Raikhiang Lake, the highest lake in Bangladesh. Chimbuk Peak and Boga Lake are two more highly noted features of the district. Another high peak, Saka Haphong (1063 m) is also here in Thanchi Upazila.</p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    It is nearly a 52 km² hill-town housing about 32,000 people, of which the majority are Marma. There is a Tribal Cultural Institute here, which features a library and a museum. The town also features Bandarban Town Hospital (offering the best medical service in the district), the District Public Library, Bandarban Government College, the District Stadium, Banashri, the solitary movie theatre, the Royal Cemetery, and, of course, the Royal Palace (two of them since the 11th and 13th royal lines both claim the throne). Apart from the numerous kyangs and mosques, there is a temple dedicated to Kali, the most revered goddess of Hindus is Bangladesh, as well as a centre maintained by ISKON.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Bandarban lies, by bus, eight hours away from Dhaka, two hours from Chittagong and three hours from Cox’s Bazaar. It is also possible to get there by a six hour bus ride from Rangamati. The shoreline of the Bay of Bengal is just 40 km away.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    The Buddha Dhatu Jadi, the largest Buddhist temple in Bangladesh, is located in Balaghata, 4 km from the town. It is also known as the bandarban Golden Temple. This place attracts many tourists every year. This Theravada Buddhist Temple is made completely in the style of South-East Asia and houses the second largest statue of Buddha in Bangladesh.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    The numerous Buddhist Temples, known as kyang in local tongue, and vihars in the town include the highly notable the Rajvihar (royal vihar) at Jadipara and the Ujanipara Bhihar. Bawm villages around Chimbuk, and Mro villages a little further off, also lie within a day’s journey from the town. Prantik Lake, Jibannagar and Kyachlong Lake are some more places of interest. Boat ride on the river Sangu is one of the main attractions here for tourists.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    The River Sangu (also known as Sangpo or Shankha), the only river born inside Bangladesh territory, runs through Bandarban. The other rivers in the district are Matamuhuri and Bakkhali. Parts of Kaptai Lake, the biggest lake in, Bangladesh fall under the area. The waterfall named Shoilo Propat at Milanchari is another place tourists like to visit.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    There are more than fifteen ethnic minorities living in the district besides the Bengalis, including: the Marma, the Arakanese descendants and Arakanese (Rakhine), who are also known as Magh, Mru (also known as Mro or Murong), Bawm, Khyang, Tripuri (also known as Tipra or Tipperah), Mizo (also known as Lushei), Khumi, Chak, Kuki, Chakma and Tenchungya, who are closely related, Reang (also known as Riyang), Uchoi (also known as Usui) and Pankho.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    The Mro, also known as Murong, who are famous for their music and dance. Mro people in major numbers have converted to Khrama (or Crama), the youngest religion in Bangladesh that prohibits much of their old ways. They are assumed to be the original inhabitants of Bandarban. The Bawm is another major tribe here. Now converted almost totally to Christianity they have taken full advantage of the church to become the most educated people in the district. The Marma are Arakanese descendants of Myanmar by origin and Buddhists by religion, and is the second largest tribe in the hill districts of Bangladesh. The Khumi live in the remotest parts of the district, and the group is thought to include yet unexplored/ unclassified tribes.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    These ethnic groups are again divided in hundreds of clans and sects, principally dominated by four religious threads – Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and a number of pagan faiths. All these clans and groups are clustered into two major ethnic families, namely the hill people and the valley people. Since the Kaptai dam flooded the valley creating to Kaptai lake, the valley people have started to live on hill tops along the hill people.
